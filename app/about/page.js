        <h1>Built to make macro data faster to read.</h1>
        <p>
          JapanPulse is an independent research workspace that brings Japan and United States
          macroeconomic indicators into a consistent, high-density dashboard. It is designed
          for monitoring direction, momentum and cross-indicator context—not for replacing
          the underlying official releases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Japanese economic statistics are fragmented across multiple government agencies and
          can be difficult to navigate, especially for non-Japanese users. JapanPulse consolidates
          key indicators, standardizes their presentation and makes Japan’s macro data easier to
          access and interpret while keeping the official source one click away.

          <h2>Data sources</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Japan: e-Stat, Bank of Japan, Cabinet Office, METI, MHLW and Japan Customs.</li>
            <li>United States: BLS, BEA, Census, Federal Reserve, U.S. Treasury and Chicago Fed data via FRED.</li>
            <li>Every dashboard identifies its source and latest available observation.</li>
          </ul>

        <article>
          <h2>Update policy</h2>
          <p>
            Data is retrieved from official APIs or published files and cached to reduce load.
            Release timing differs by indicator, so “latest” means the newest official
            observation available for that series—not a common calendar month across all pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Workspace summaries use an edge-cached aggregate endpoint and automatically fall
            back to independent card-level requests when a source is slow. Cached browser
            snapshots can preserve the last complete workspace while a refresh is incomplete.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <Link href="/status">Data Status monitor</Link> identifies current, reference,
            stale and failed feeds and separates live data from preserved snapshots.

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            Growth rates, annualized momentum and contributions are calculated from published
            index levels where noted. Seasonal-adjustment status and transformation definitions
            are shown on individual dashboards. Survey and hard-data indicators remain
            separated to avoid false comparability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Market-implied measures such as Treasury breakevens are treated as pricing signals,
            not pure forecasts. They can include risk, liquidity and term premia in addition to
            expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yen pass-through views distinguish a higher USD/JPY rate (yen depreciation) from
            higher BOJ effective exchange-rate indices (yen appreciation). Co-movement with
            import or consumer prices is descriptive and is not presented as a causal estimate.
          </p>
          <p>
            CPI scenario paths compound the selected constant monthly rate from the latest
            seasonally adjusted official index and compare each projected level with its actual
            year-ago index. They are conditional arithmetic paths—not forecasts—and missing
            official comparison months are not interpolated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The US dining-demand proxy divides seasonally adjusted Census restaurant sales by
            the BLS food-away-from-home CPI. Its growth rate is an approximate real-spending
            signal, not a chain-weighted BEA consumption measure, and the advance sales estimate
            is subject to revision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Retail-sales headlines use one common advance-release month, while category breadth
            retains the latest common month from the revised Monthly Retail Trade Survey. Housing
            cards retain their individual weekly, monthly or quarterly observation dates rather
            than presenting different frequencies as if they were a single-period comparison.

            Dashboard stars are an editorial monitoring hierarchy—not a rating of data quality,
            reliability or forecast accuracy. <strong>★★★ Core</strong> indicators have broad
            cycle, policy or market relevance. <strong>★★ Supporting</strong> indicators add
            timely confirmation, leading detail or a transmission channel. <strong>★ Specialized</strong>
            indicators answer a narrower sector question and are best read with broader data.
